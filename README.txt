My idea is about drawing a Nike shoe with the logo Nike Swoosh using Hermite piecewise curve for all of the drawing. Here is how I satisfy all of the requirements to deserve a "3":

Requirement 1: I satisfy both of the options. First my piecewise-defined curve forms the shape of a shoe. It is a closed loop. Each piece of the loop shifts from one formula to another. The same concept applies to the Nike Swoosh logo
Furthermore, I have 2 separate curves which are the two shoelaces that is connected to the shoe frame.

Requirement 2: I have drawn a symbol that animates (travels) along the trajectory created by the Nike Swoosh logo. And I also have the curve control the orientation of the moving object.

Requirement 3: Each of the pieces of the big curve are colored a different way to meet the requirement.

Requirement 4: Since the pieces of the big curve meets each other at the same point. Therefore, my curves should have at least C0-continuity.

Requirement 5: I use Hermite.

And here is why I believe I can compete for a 4:

1) control the orientation of objects based on the curve of the Nike Swoosh
2) I have intriguing motions and shapes (shoe laces flying)
3) I give the "thickness" for my curves
